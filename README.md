# Derivations of Equations in PRML by C. Bishop

As I read through PRML (Feb 2006 edition), I made notes on derivations of non-trivial equations. There are many solution manuals available for the exercises, but none for the equations in the text itself. So I thought my solutions might help others to push through this difficult book. Bishop assigned many equations in the text as exercises, and I did not include them in my document. The following is the list of the solution manuals for exercices available on the internet.  
<ol>
<li> PRML Solutions to Exercises: Tutorâ€™s Edition </li>
<li> PRML Solutions to Exercises: Web Edition </li>
<li> Solution Manual for PRML by Zhengqi Gao </li>
</ol>

I used the same mathematical notation as in PRML except for <b> t </b>, which is a column vector of a list of observations in this document. 
<ol>
<li> t: a binary-categorical target value. </li>
<li> <b> t </b>: a vector for multi-categorical target values. ${t_1, t_2, \cdots , t_M }$, where M is the dimension of the feature space. </li>
<li> $\overline{\textbf{t}}$: a vector for a list of observations of binary-categorical target values. ${t_1, t_2, \cdots , t_N }$, where N is the number of observations. </li>
</ol>
